<strong><li><p><h2>Forex trading, we can also term it as"foreign exchange trading"<br> involves the buying and selling of currencies in a decentralized global market.<br> It's the largest and most liquid financial global market, operating 24 hours a day, five days a week.<br> With the widest daily volume over $8 trillion For beginners, understanding the fundamentals is crucial before diving into trading.</h2></p></li></strong>
<h3> Start by Understanding the Forex Market</h3>
<p>The forex market operates over-the-counter (OTC), meaning that  there's no centralized exchange of currencies.<br> Transactions occur electronically between participants globally,although the system is decentralised,the forex market has it's guiding hierarchical structure that dictates how traders interact and trade.<br><img src="2.jpg"> <br> Major trading centers include London, New York, Tokyo, and Sydney, <br> allowing continuous trading as markets open and close across different time zones.<br> Understading how the forex market operates can help you to comprehend the flow of trasactions and  the various roles performed by different identities within the forex market.  </p>
<h3>Currency Pairs</h3>
Currencies are traded in pairs, representing the value of one currency relative to another. <br>The first currency in the pair is the base currency, and the second is the quote currency. <br>For example, in the GBP/USD pair, GPB is the base currency, and USD is the quote currency. Therefore if the pair is priced at 1.19, it means one pound is equivalent to 1.19 U.S. dollars.
